# Mean Validator

### Challenge

The challenge consist on a implementation of a algoritm that can be inputed `n` numbers and the algorithm will:

- Calculate the overall mean between all the inputs;
- Calculate the mean between the biggest and the smallest inputs;
- Display to the user a message that informs if the overall mean is greater than, less than or equal to the biggest-smallest mean.

`Obs.: Arrays cannot be used!`

### DoD

- Has a flowchart for the algorithm;
- Algorithm was implemented with C.
